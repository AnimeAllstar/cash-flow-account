# Cash Flow Account

## Overview 

**Cash Flow Account** is an application designed to track an individual's expenditures and earnings over time. It does **not** function as a bank account that restricts you from making purchasing that exceed your balance. Instead, the purpose of this application is to help users to understand their spending habits by categorizing their *income* and *expenditure*.

The application is meant to be used by users of all demographics who wish to better understand the sources of their income and what they spend their money on.

This project personally interested me as I wanted to way to record my expenses and understand where I spend my money. I did not want to wonder why I spent $50 two months ago and have miscellaneous expenses that I cannot recollect making in my bank statements. Also, by understanding where I spend my money, I would be able to curb my spending as being an international student at University is expensive.
